                <h1>Bloodborne</h1>
                <h2>Fear the Old Blood..</h2>
                <h3>An old Driver</h3>
                <p><b>Bloodborne</b> (Japanese: ブラッドボーン) is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by <a href="#">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. Officially announced at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the game was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 in March 2015.
                    <br> Bloodborne follows the player character, the Hunter, through the fictional decrepit Gothic city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants have been afflicted with an abnormal blood-borne disease. Upon mysteriously awakening in Yharnam during the night of "The Hunt", the Hunter seeks out something known only as "Paleblood" for reasons unknown. The Hunter begins to unravel Yharnam's intriguing mysteries while hunting down its many terrifying beasts.

                <p>
                    Eventually, the Hunter's objective is to locate and terminate the source of the plague, and escape the nightmare to return to the 'real world', known as the "Waking World". The game is played from a third-person perspective, players control a fully customizable protagonist, and gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and exploration. Players battle beastly and varied enemies, including bosses, using items such as swords and firearms, and journey through the story, exploring the game's different locations, interacting with non-player characters, collecting key items involved in the story, and discovering and unraveling the world's many mysteries. Another trait of the game is its notorious difficulty, with some gaming publications calling it "brutal", while others said it was "difficult, but fair".</p>
